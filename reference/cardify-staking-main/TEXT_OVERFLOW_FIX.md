# Text Overflow Fix for Message Bubbles

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The wallet addresses in message bubbles were overflowing and getting cut off, making them unreadable. This was happening because:
- Long wallet addresses (44+ characters) were too wide for the message containers
- No text wrapping was applied to long strings
- Fixed width containers couldn't accommodate variable-length content

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Text Wrapping**
- Added `break-words` class to all message bubbles
- Applied to both message text and sender information
- Ensures long text wraps properly within containers

### 2. **Responsive Container Sizing**
- **Before**: Fixed `max-w-xs lg:max-w-md` (too narrow)
- **After**: Responsive `max-w-xs sm:max-w-sm md:max-w-md lg:max-w-lg`
- Better sizing across all screen sizes

### 3. **Smart Address Truncation**
- **Long addresses** (>20 chars): Display as `39NqKccV...adVxyL5N`
- **Short addresses** (≤20 chars): Display in full
- Applied to sender information in message bubbles

### 4. **Improved Message Layout**
- Better spacing and padding for readability
- Consistent styling across all message types
- Proper text alignment and overflow handling

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **Before (Overflow Issues)**
```css
/* Fixed narrow width, no text wrapping */
max-w-xs lg:max-w-md
/* Long addresses would overflow */
39NqKccVeTcND38fJWDU1FE7guFk4nCznJ3WadVxyL5N
```

### **After (Responsive & Wrapped)**
```css
/* Responsive width with text wrapping */
max-w-xs sm:max-w-sm md:max-w-md lg:max-w-lg break-words
/* Long addresses are truncated intelligently */
39NqKccV...adVxyL5N
```
