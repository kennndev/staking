# Closed Ticket Functionality

## 🔒 **Feature Overview**
When a ticket status is set to "closed", users and admins can no longer add new messages to prevent further discussion and maintain ticket closure.

## 🎯 **Implementation Details**

### **1. User Interface (TicketModal)**
When a ticket is closed, the reply input is replaced with a disabled message:

```tsx
{ticket.status === 'closed' ? (
  <div className="bg-gray-600/20 border border-gray-500/50 rounded-lg p-4 text-center">
    <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
      This ticket is closed. No more messages can be added.
    </p>
  </div>
) : (
  // Normal reply input
)}
```

### **2. Admin Interface (AdminSection)**
Admin reply functionality is also disabled for closed tickets:

```tsx
{selectedTicket.status === 'closed' ? (
  <div className="bg-gray-600/20 border border-gray-500/50 rounded-lg p-4 text-center">
    <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
      This ticket is closed. Admin replies are disabled.
    </p>
  </div>
) : (
  // Normal admin reply input
)}
```

### **3. Visual Indicators**
Added "LOCKED" badge to closed tickets in the ticket list:

```tsx
{ticket.status === 'closed' && (
  <span className="text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded font-medium bg-gray-600 text-white">
    LOCKED
  </span>
)}
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

```
